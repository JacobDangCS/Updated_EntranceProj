# Movie Recommendation Project

## Description: 
* This project was designed as a submission for the 301 Entrance Exam <br>
* Demonstrates novice HTML, Javascript, and CSS knowledge

## About Me:
* My name is Jacob Dang and I found Code Fellows through a collegue of mine. My background in software engineering and front-end development is minimal but I have experimented with self-taught programs such as Codecademy, theOdinProject, Exercism, freeCodeCamp, teachyourselfcs, and many other resources in order to prepare myself thoroughly for more professional and advance courses.

## About Project:
* This project idea was formulated after wanting to integrate an aspect of myself into this project, and with my accumlated knowledge of basic coding, I thought it'd be a fun idea to test out and see where it would lead to.
